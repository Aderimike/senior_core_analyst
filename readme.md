## Senior Growth Analyst
Hi there!
If you are able to see this repo, you have moved to the next step of this hiring process, congratulations!

As part of the hiring process at Affirm we need to evaluate your technical skills. This take-home assessment has all the components that you will be using at work once you join the team, so hopefully, this is also a good opportunity to evaluate if you like what you willbe working on.

Some of the hard skills we are trying to evaluate:
* Github (for starters)
* SQL
* Python


## Data 
This Github repo has three files in data, please use them as reference moving forward.

## Delivery 
Please clone this branch locally and submit your branch using a PR.


## SQL
1. Please review the integrity of the data. Do you notice any data anomalies? If so, please describe them.

|date      |num_loaded|num_applied|num_approved|num_confirmed|application_rate|approval_rate|confirmation_rate|
|__________|__________|___________|____________|_____________|________________|_____________|_________________|
|2016-05-01|100       |80         |60          |30           |0.8             |0.75         |0.50             |
|2016-05-02|120       |90         |81          |63           |0.75            |0.90         |0.78             |

2. Calculate conversion through the funnel by day such that the data structure is:

3.  Which merchant industry and/or user demographic would you focus business development on based on current checkout funnel and loan performance? (Assume we have roughly the same market penetration in each so that saturation isn't a concern and assume revenue to Affirm = (mdr + loan_return_percentage) * loan_amount). Please put together a 3-page PowerPoint presentation to the executive team with your recommendation (title and agenda slides donâ€™t count in the total).
